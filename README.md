- 👋 Hi, I’m @ch11nv11n
  
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills to become a developer. I’m currently honing my skills by working on projects.
  
- 🌱 I've recently built my first "Sofle" split keyboard, using QMK. I have mastered the Colemak keyboard layout and continue to use the QWERTY layout as well contributing to my ongoing pursuit of enhancing typing proficiency and efficiency.
  
- 💞️ I'm all in for collaborating on any kind of project! It's a great way for me to improve my skills and I'm always ready to help others succeed in their goals.
  
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord @ch11nv11n
