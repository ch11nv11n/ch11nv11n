- 👋 Hi, I’m @ch11nv11n
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills to become a python developer. I recently finished building my first keyboard the "Sofle" so I'm living that split keeb life and loving it! It uses QMK and I'm learning the Colemak layout on it. 

- 🌱 I’m currently practicing my python skills and recently finished the CS50p course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really to get my skills up
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord @ ch11nv11n#8812
