- 👋 Hi, I’m @ch11nv11n
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills to become a Python developer.
- I've recently built my first "Sofle" split keyboard, using QMK. I am in the process of mastering the Colemak keyboard layout, contributing to my ongoing pursuit of enhancing typing proficiency and efficiency.

- 🌱 I’m currently honing my Python skills by working on projects
- 💞️ I'm all in for collaborating on any kind of project! It's a great way for me to improve my skills and I'm always ready to help others succeed in their goals.
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord @ch11nv11n
