- 👋 Hi, I’m @ch11nv11n
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my coding skills to become a developer. I have recently gotten into building keyboards and my first build was the Sofle so I'm living that split keeb life!
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through the courseware CS50 course and reading "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python".
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really to get my skills up
- 📫 You can reach me on Discord @ ch11nv11n#8812
